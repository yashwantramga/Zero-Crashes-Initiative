# Introduction
Welcome to the era of "Zero Crashes," a groundbreaking initiative poised to redefine transportation safety and usher in a new age of accident-free mobility.
This visionary endeavor is the result of a collaborative effort between industry leaders, policymakers, and technology innovators, uniting in the pursuit of a world where traffic accidents are relegated to the annals of history. Zero Crashes represents more than just a campaign; it embodies a collective vision that envisages a future where road safety is a fundamental right for everyone.
# Problem Statement
The 3 main reasons for accidents are Roads, Vehicles and Driving style. Due to the exponentially increasing number of vehicles on the road, the number of accidents occurring on a daily basis is also increasing at an alarming rate. With the high number of traffic incidents and deaths these days, the ability to forecast the number
of traffic accidents over a given time is important for the transportation department to make scientific decisions. In this scenario, it will be good to analyze the
occurrence of accidents so that this can be further used to help us in coming up with techniques to reduce them.
# Objective

The main objective of our process is,To achieve the Zero crashes, To reduce the number of road crash fatalities on the road sides, It is useful for every people who are using road vehicles to travel,It also helps the people to take safer routes.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the successful deployment and rigorous testing of the application in real locations within the Virudhunagar hotspot areas mark a significant milestone in our project. The "Zero Crashes" initiative has demonstrated its potential to substantially reduce the number of
accidents and, most importantly, fatalities. Through the systematic integration of advanced technologies, including IoT, machine
learning, and real-time data analysis, we have effectively addressed safety concerns in accidentprone zones. By actively identifying accident hotspots, notifying users about speed limits, and promptly alerting them to violations, our application has ushered in a new era of proactive accident prevention.
